about:
  title: What I am all about
  paras:
    - Oracle certified Java, J2EE Developer and Microsoft certified HTML, CSS3 and Javascript Developer having 5 years of professional experience in developing Single Page Web Applications. I specialise in developing/architecting production ready web applications based on customer needs. My choice of technologies for building web applications include Java, Spring or NodeJS for Restful Web Services, AngularJS, ReactJS and Redux for User Interface development and Maven, Glup & Webpack as build tools.
    - I have a strong passion for the creativity, commitment and discipline that goes into development. Keeping in mind scalability and clean code that is maintainable and readable. I'm continuous learner and currently teaching myself Java 8, Spring Boot, Jenkins and Angular 2. I keep myself updated with current market trends and try to do small PoC's to understand concepts.
